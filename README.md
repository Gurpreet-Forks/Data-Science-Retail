# Data-Science-Retail
Data Analysis for Retail Case Studies 

## Introduction
The purpose of these case studies is to demonstrate how users can perform basic tasks required for any data analysis project(in school or at work) 

Some of these tasks include:
1. Sample Data Generation (for testing and validation)
2. Extraction of Raw Data (from conventional sources such as csv files)
3. Conversion of Data (from one format to another)
3. Exploration of Data (types and features)
4. Manipulation of Data (e.g. creating new columns from existing data)
5. Visualization of Data (in plots, graphs or charts)
6. Storing Data in a relational database (e.g. SQL database format)

## Contents
Each Case Study will contain the following files:

.py - Generates the data

.csv - Sample data generated by the python script

.ipynb - Notebook to import, analyze and visualize the data

.sqlite - Data stored inside a relational database

## Getting Started
Run the .ipynb file to analyze the pre-generated data.
The .py file can be edited to generate more complex data.

## Prerequisites / Recommended Software
